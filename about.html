<h1>Brynn Devers</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Brynn, and I am a student at William Jewell College. Here I am on the lacrosse team. In my free time, I like to play music, as I play multiple instruments and listen to every genre. Before I came to Jewell, I was going to Iowa State University and pursuing a degree in Aerospace Engineering. While I was there, I was also in a sorority.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, one of my favorite hobbies is playing music; I play the piano, guitar, and bass among other instruments. To me, there is nothing better than sitting down at the piano after a long day.</p>
